# Final-Project-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the final project for LIS 5937. This project was so much fun and really solidified my understanding of certain concepts. I am extremely grateful for the practices and course materials during this semester.

I set out to create a game that allows a user to go head-to-head against the computer in the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. I wanted to create an algorithm for the computer to play its turn without the user aiding it in any way.

From the examples, I really gravitated towards game simulators. I wanted to take it a step further and also include ways to combat bugs in the program. Humans are faulty. Therefore, in order for one to enjoy the game without the program breaking every time the incorrect type was inputted, a variety of cases needed to be considered. Running the code and inputting incorrect types, you will be able to see the program redirecting the user to “try again”.

The methodology I used mainly was trial and error. I would first type lines of code that I thought would execute, and there were MANY times that it did not work out the way I first envisioned. I also relied on Visual Studio Code to scan through each line to find the root of the problems I encountered. In addition, in order for the computer to play its turn, I needed to create an algorithm. After the user chooses their spot on the board, the program detects what spots are leftover and chooses a random one to select. The computer is not the cleverest at the game, however this project gave me a different perspective for the future of Artificial Intelligence.
